# STATIC ADS KNOWLEDGE BASE

## Ad Anatomy

### Essential Components
1. **Headline/Hook:** Grabs attention (3-6 words, bold, clear font)
2. **Visual/Product Image:** Hero element (high-res lifestyle or product shots)
3. **Offer/CTA Area:** Drives action (clear offer + button-like CTA)
4. **Branding:** Builds recognition (logo, colors, fonts)
5. **Supporting Text (Optional):** Adds context if space allows

## Design Guidelines

### Brand Identity
- Logo placement: bottom right or bottom middle (min 64px padding)
- Fonts: Helvetica Neue (headlines), Inter (body/CTA)
- Colors:
  - #000000 - text
  - #fd8c68 - highlight promos, discounts, bundles
  - #FFFFFF - text
  - #9b90b4 - main color, gradients, backgrounds

### Layout Tips
- Maintain 20% text-to-image ratio (Meta standard)
- High contrast between background and text
- Include negative space for readability
- Design for 1:1 and 9:16 ratios (cropping safe zones)

## Copywriting Frameworks

### Offer-Value-CTA
What's the deal → Why it matters → What to do
Example: "35% OFF Diffusers → Instantly elevate your home → Shop Now"

### Problem-Solution
Identify pain → Present product → CTA
Example: "Tired of stuffy air? → Refresh your space with Zennya → Try It Today"

### Social Proof
Show credibility → CTA
Example: "Loved by 120,000+ homes → Experience it yourself → Shop Now"

### Seasonal/Urgency
Time trigger → Offer → CTA
Example: "This 11.11 only → Up to 35% OFF + Free Gift → Don't Miss Out"
